# Projects ğŸ‘“
These are Projects based in Javascript and such, from The Odin Project and Free Code Camp. Download and open each project, please :-) I had to update some (Attn: updated January 2020) because some of the code was a bit messed up and needed improvements.

# Why? ğŸ¤·

I was in HackYourOwn's learning cohort in Summer 2020, and these were the platforms we used. Very resourceful!
